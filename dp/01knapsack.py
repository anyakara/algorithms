# total profit maximized
# 0/1 knapsack problem

# m = 8
# n = 4

# p = {1, 2, 5, 6}
# w = {2, 3, 4, 5}


# consider all previous row objects when at any ith row -- filled only when bag capacity is 2 -- fill 1

# sum of their profits should be maximized
# sum of their weights should be less than or equal to the size of the bag

# dynamic programming is used for optimization problems
# all possible solutions and pick the best one
# 0000 1111 0001 1000 1100 - many possible solutions
# that is still the dynamic programming implementation of this -- that I think would be ideal for future implementations
